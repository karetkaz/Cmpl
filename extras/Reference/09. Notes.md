## Compilation memory management

The memory is organized in 4 segments:

- meta: read only
	- identifiers and string constants (are emitted in the compilation phase).
	- typename and variable metadata (are emitted in the compilation phase).
	- [TODO] enumeration values.

- code: read only
	- functions body.

- data: writeable
	- static variables.

- heap: writeable
	- heap memory
	- stack(s).

[TODO] code and data are mixed together.
[TODO] enums are generated int the mixed code + data section.

In the compilation phase the lower part of the memory is filled with persistent data which remains available for code execution,
while the upper part is filled with token structures and other temporary data, that will be overwritten on code execution.

## Constant evaluation [TODO]

Constant expression evaluation should be done by the vm.

An expression is constant:

- if no memory writing is performed except on the top of the stack.
- memory read occurs only from the read only region.
- no non const function is invoked?
- no native call is invoked? (what about sin(double x) and the others).
- no stack manipulation is performed?
