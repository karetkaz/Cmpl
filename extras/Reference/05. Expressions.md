- slice operator:

int b[] = a[10 : 20];
OR? int b[] = a[10 , 20];
OR? int b[] = a[10 ... 20];

Expressions are responsible for computing values.

## Constants

Compile time constant expressions:

- A compile time constant expression is an expression whose value can be determined at compile time
(during verification), before any part of the program has been executed.

- Expressions in certain contexts are required to be compile time constant expressions.
	- the size of a static array: int a[20];
	- the condition of a `static if` statement: static if (true) {...}

## Identifiers

Used to reference typename, variable and function.

## Unary expressions

```
!: logical not. Results true or false.
~: ones complement. Valid for integer types.
-: unary minus. Change the sign of a number.
+: unary plus. ???
```

## Binary expressions

### Arithmetic expressions

```
+, -,
*, /, %,
&, |, ^,
<<, >>, >>>
```

Are used to return new values computed from the two operands.

### Relational expressions

```
==, !=, ===, !==,
<, <=, >, >=
```

Are used to return true or false based on the comparation of the left and right operand.

### Logical expressions

```
||, &&, ?:
```

- The `||` (logical or) operator returns true if **any** of its operands is true.

**Example:**

```
bool variable = a || b || c || d;
```

The value of `variable` will be true if any of the variables(a, b, c, d) is evaluated to true.
The evaluation of the values stops when the first expression is evaluated to true.


- The `&&` (logical and) operator returns true if **all** of its operands is true.

**Example:**

```
bool variable = a && b && c && d;
```

The value of `variable` will be true if all of the variables(a, b, c, d) is evaluated to true.
The evaluation of the values stops when the first expression is evaluated to false.


- The `?:` (conditional) operator is a ternary operator, which means that it has 3 arguments.

**Example:**

```
int variable = (condition ? trueValue : falseValue);
```

Evaluates the first argument(condition) and returns evaluating the second argument(trueValue) if the condition is true,
or the third argument(falseValue) in case the condition is evaluated to false.

### Assignment expressions

```
=,
+=, -=, *=, /=, %=,
&=, |=, ^=,
<<=, >>=, >>>=
```
- Are used to calculate and store new values in the left operand, returning the right operand.
- The composed operators are expanded, this means that `a += 3 + b` is converted to `a = a + (3 + b)`.
