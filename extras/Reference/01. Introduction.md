# Features:

- Syntax is similar to c/c++ influenced by:
	- [Javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)
	- [D programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_(programming_language))
	- [C# programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language))
	- [Lua programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language))
	
- Arrays are more than just pointers.
	- Fixed size arrays(size is known by the compiler `int fixed[30]`)
	- Dynamic size arrays(size is known at runtime `int dynamic[] = fixed;`)
	- Unknown size arrays(used mostly for native calls `int memcmp(byte a[*], byte b[*], int size);`)
	- Associative arrays(`double constants[string] = {"pi": 3.1415, ...};`)[TODO]

- Types are themselves variables of type `typename`.
	- Can be parameters of functions `uint sizeof(typename type) { return type.size; }`
	- Reflection is part of the language (some internal compiler functions needs to be exposed).
	- Variant is a builtin dynamic type, a pair of type and data: (typename type, pointer data).

- Enumeration values are constants of the given type (numbers, objects, functions, ...).

- Expressions and typenames can be aliased with the `inline` keyword.
	- aliasing a typename: `inline int = int32;`
	- aliasing an expression: `inline min(int a, int b) = a < b ? a : b;`

- Conditional compile-time code generation and declarations with `static if` statement.
	- Check if int has 32 bits: `static if (int == int32) { ... }`

- `new` and `this` are not part of the language.
	- Create and initialize objects like in JavaScript `complex a = {re: 42, im: 2};`
	- Simply use [Uniform Function Call Syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Function_Call_Syntax) because:
		- `this` is usually not the expected object ...
		- Allows to implement custom extension methods.
		- Less null checks: `x.isEmpty()` may simply returns `true`, when x is a null string.
