# Features:

- Syntax is similar to c/c++

- Types are themselves variables of type typename.

- A very simple reflection type system can be implemented this way.

- Enumeration values are constants of the given type.

- Enumeration type variables can be assigned only with one of the declared values (or null).

- Expressions and typenames can be aliased with the `inline` keyword.

- Conditional compile-time code generation and declarations with `ststic if` statement.

- `new` and `this` are not part of the language.
